On the way home with my niece from school, I got really surprised about the topic she was given for her homework assignment. She needed to write an essay on "Does Democracy Require Equality of Income or Wealth?". This is no easy topic to write about considering her age. Being a good uncle and a writer I decided to give it a shot myself. Here's is my take on the topic.

**Democracy** is a form of government where power is held by the people and exercised through free and fair elections. Political equality is considered the cornerstone of democracy as it gives every citizen the right to participate in the political process on an equal footing. However, this political equality is often threatened by economic inequality, which gives some citizens a greater voice and influence in the democratic process due to their greater economic resources.

*Robert Dahl*, one of the foremost political scientists of the 20th century, believed that economic inequality results in unequal political resources and undermines the achievement of political equality. In a democracy, citizens who are unequal in economic resources are likely to be unequal in political resources, making it difficult for the democratic process to truly represent the interests of all citizens. This is because individuals and companies with more economic resources can influence politics and policies, regardless of the wants and needs of the majority of citizens.

**For example**, the ongoing debate over raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour is a prime example of how economic resources can influence the political process. Despite the fact that 67% of Americans support raising the minimum wage, the argument against it is largely driven by the interests of profitable companies, who would lose profit if the minimum wage were raised. This demonstrates how the voices of those with more economic resources can drown out the voices of the majority.

**Another example** of the impact of economic inequality on the democratic process is the influence of large donations on political campaigns. Wealthy individuals, corporations, and non-profit organizations can donate unlimited amounts of money to political campaigns through various avenues, including individual donations, super PACs, and political action committees. This gives those with more economic resources the ability to influence political outcomes, as the largest donations are often directed towards the loudest supporters.

In order to ensure that democracy **truly represents** the interests of all citizens, it is important to separate wealth and income from politics. Making a country more egalitarian, through equal access to resources, opportunities, and aid, will help to level the playing field and allow every citizen to participate in the democratic process on an equal footing. This will help to prevent the concentration of political power in the hands of a select few, and ensure that the democratic process truly represents the interests of all citizens.

**In conclusion**, democracy does not require equality of income or wealth, but it is essential for political equality to be maintained. Economic inequality can undermine the achievement of political equality, and it is important for democratic societies to ensure that wealth and income are separated from politics in order to ensure that every citizen has an equal voice and equal influence in the democratic process.
