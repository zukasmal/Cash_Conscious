Your credit score is a three-digit number that can have a major impact on your financial life. It determines your creditworthiness and can affect everything from getting approved for a loan to the interest rate you pay on a credit card. A good credit score can save you thousands of dollars in interest over the course of your lifetime, while a poor credit score can make it difficult to access credit and may result in higher interest rates.

## What is a credit score and how is it determined?
- A credit score ranges from 300 to 850 
- It's based on information from your credit report
- A score of 700 or above is considered good
- A score of 750 or above is considered excellent

## Factors that determine a credit score
- **Payment history**: 35% 
- **Credit utilization**: 30% 
- **Length of credit history**: 15%
- **Credit mix**: 10%
- **New credit**: 10%

## How to improve your credit score
- **Pay your bills on time**: Late payments can have a significant negative impact on your score
- **Keep your credit utilization low**: credit utilization should be below 30%
- **Don't close old credit accounts**: Closing old credit accounts can shorten the length of your credit history
- **Don't open new credit accounts unnecessarily**: Every time you open a new credit account, it can have a negative impact on your score

It's also important to regularly check your credit report for errors and to dispute any inaccuracies. You're entitled to a free credit report from each of the three major credit bureaus once a year.

By understanding how your credit score is determined and taking steps to improve it, you can take control of your credit and financial future.
